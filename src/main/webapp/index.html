			<h3><a href="play?game=orderring">OrderRing</a> - 7 January 2013</h3>
			<p>In this game, the object is to order several circles by number from left to right, and to do it with as few shots and collisions as possible.</p>
			<p><a href="scores?game=orderring&display=topten">High scores</a></p>
			<h3><a href="play?game=circlebouncer">Circle Bouncer</a> - 6 January 2013</h3>
			<p>In this game, the circles bounce around!  How surprising...  The goal is to obtain as many points as possible by bouncing into circles as indirectly as possible.</p>
			<p><a href="scores?game=circlebouncer&display=topten">High scores</a></p>
			<h3><a href="play?game=centipede">Centipede</a> - 3 January 2013</h3>
			<p>The purple Xs have returned, this time in some sort of centipede formation...  and somehow they transform into mushrooms upon death...  what is going on?  My sincerest apologies for the long delay in putting up a new game; the week has been rather busy with spending time with family and whatnot.  Also, expect a few updates to Centipede, hopefully fairly soon, as I finish adding a few final touches.</p>
			<h3>Merry Christmas! - 25 December 2012</h3>
			<p>I apologize for not having a new game up yesterday due to being busy with holiday celebrations, and will most likely not have a new game up tomorrow either; however, I will try my best to put up a new game on Friday.  I did, however, make some changes to the site such that I can now display comments on each game!</p>
			<h3><a href="play?game=circlejump">CircleJump</a> - 21 December 2012</h3>
			<p>The goal of this game is to jump between rotating circles, gaining more points for the longer the jump, with three modes of play: Arcade, in which you have 3 lives and lose one every time you revisit a circle; Timed, in which you have a limited amount of time to score as many points as possible; and Strategy, in which you only get 10 jumps to score as much as possible.</p>

			<h3><a href="play?game=kiwirun">Kiwi-Run</a> - 19 December 2012</h3>
			<p>Oh no! You were minding your own business trying to catch a few worms for lunch, when suddenly a purple alien appeared; fearing what he might do to you, you started
running, but as luck would have it you ran straight into a field of rocks! See how long you can catch worms while avoiding both rocks and the alien.</p>

			<h3><a href="play?game=lasers">Lasers</a> - 18 December 2012</h3>
			<p>Someone is trying to kill you by shooting you with red lasers (and they aren't doing a very good job...  at first.)  See how long you can stay alive!  Also check out some updates to <a href="play?game=invaders">Invaders</a> that are the reason today's game is not very complex.</p>
			<p><a href="scores?game=lasers&display=topten">High scores</a></p>
			<h3><a href="play?game=invaders">Invaders</a> - 17 December 2012</h3>
			<p>The purple Xs are back, and this time they are invading your home... planet? continent? slice of reality? Whatever it is, they want it, and it is your job to defend it.</p>
			<p><a href="scores?game=invaders&display=topten">High scores</a></p>
			<h3><a href="play?game=robots">Robots</a> - 15 December 2012</h3>
			<p>This is the classic robot game in which you are surrounded by killer robots and your only chance is to get them to crash into each other or the piles of junk caused by said crashing.  You are given a limited number of safe teleports each level, after which a teleport could land you right next to a robot!</p>
			<p><a href="scores?game=robots&display=topten">High scores</a></p>
			<h3><a href="play?game=blocks">Blocks</a> - 14 December 2012</h3>
			<p>Somewhat similar to the classic Tetris, the goal of this game is to clear rows of blocks by filling the entire row or column; however, blocks may be placed anywhere by clicking rather than as they fall, and there is no time constraint.  The game ends when a block cannot be placed.</p>
			<p>High scores: <a href="scores?game=blocks5_5&display=topten">5 x 5</a>, <a href="scores?game=blocks6_6&display=topten">6 x 6</a>, <a href="scores?game=blocks7_7&display=topten">7 x 7</a>, <a href="scores?game=blocks8_8&display=topten">8 x 8</a>, <a href="scores?game=blocks9_9&display=topten">9 x 9</a>, <a href="scores?game=blocks5_8&display=topten">5 x 8</a></p>
